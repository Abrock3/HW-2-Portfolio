# HW-2-Portfolio

## Description

As a homework assignment in my web developer boot camp, I was given this mock user story:
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

I was asked to use the following list of acceptance criteria to create a portfolio page and satisfactorily resolve the user story:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I wrote almost all of it from scratch, using a mobile-first approach to responsiveness and later added breakpoints for larger browser resolutions. In addition I tried to make it as accessible as possible, using descriptive elements, contrasting colors, and alt tags where necessary. I needed to use placeholders for my works, as I have no original works (aside from the code refactoring project) completed at this time. 

## Usage

To handle the anchors that darken on hover, I modified a snippet of code on a stack overflow post by this user: https://stackoverflow.com/users/4450275/sabba-keynejad.

I used https://coolors.co/ to help me decide on a color scheme.
